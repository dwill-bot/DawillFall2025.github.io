        Web browsers are one of the most important tools for using the World Wide Web. They allow people to open websites, view information, and interact with content across the internet. Browsers take code like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and turn it into the web pages we use every day letting us easily interact with online content. The first browsers were simple text-based programs, but over time they developed into advanced platforms with features like built-in security, multimedia support, and the ability to sync across different devices. It would be hard to imagine life without browsers- they help us find information and connect with businesses and people. The story of how browsers changed over time is closely tied to the history of the internet itself.
